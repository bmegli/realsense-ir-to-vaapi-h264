# realsense-ir-to-vaapi-h264

This program is example how to use:
 - VAAPI through [HVE](https://github.com/bmegli/hardware-video-encoder) (FFmpeg) to hardware encode
 - Realsense D400 greyscale infrared stream 
 - to H.264 raw video
 - stored to disk as example

## CPU usage

As reported by `htop` (percentage used, 100% would mean core fully utilzed).

| Platform               | CPU       |  640x480 | 1280x720 |
|------------------------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Latte Panda Alpha      | M3-7Y30   |  15%     |   25%    |
| High end laptop (2017) | i7-7820HK |  10%     |   12%    |

## Platforms 

Unix-like operating systems (e.g. Linux).
Tested on Ubuntu 18.04.

## Hardware

- D400 series camera
- Intel VAAPI compatible hardware encoder ([Quick Sync Video](https://ark.intel.com/Search/FeatureFilter?productType=processors&QuickSyncVideo=true))

Tested with D435 camera. There is possibility that it will also work with Amd/Nvidia hardware.

## What it does

- process user input (width, height, framerate, time to capture)
- init file for raw H.264 output
- init Realsense D400 device
- init VAAPI encoder with HVE
- read greyscale IR data from the camera
- encode to H.264
- write to raw H.264 file
- cleanup

Currently VAAPI NV12 Y is filled with infrared greyscale and color plane is filled with constant value.

## Dependencies

Program depends on:
- [librealsense2](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense) 
- [HVE Hardware Video Encoder](https://github.com/bmegli/hardware-video-encoder)
   - FFmpeg avcodec and avutil (requires at least 3.4 version)

Install RealSenseâ„¢ SDK 2.0 as described on [github](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense) 

HVE is included as submodule, you only need to meet its dependencies (FFmpeg).

HVE works with system FFmpeg on Ubuntu 18.04 and doesn't on 16.04.
Ubuntu 16.04 has outdated FFmpeg (compile you own or use non-official packages).

## Building Instructions

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04.

``` bash
# update package repositories
sudo apt-get update 
# get avcodec and avutil (and ffmpeg for testing)
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg libavcodec-dev libavutil-dev
# get compilers and make
sudo apt-get install build-essential
# get cmake - we need to specify libcurl4 for Ubuntu 18.04 dependencies problem
sudo apt-get install libcurl4 cmake
# get git
sudo apt-get install git
# clone the repository (don't forget `--recursive` for submodule!)
git clone --recursive https://github.com/bmegli/realsense-ir-to-vaapi-h264.git

# finally build the program
cd realsense-ir-to-vaapi-h264
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Running 

``` bash
# realsense-ir-to-vaapi-h264 width height framerate nr_of_seconds [device]
# e.g
./realsense-ir-to-vaapi-h264 640 360 30 5
```

Details:
- width and height have to be supported by D400 camera and H.264
- framerate has to be supported by D400 camera

### Troubleshooting

If you have multiple VAAPI devices you may have to specify Intel directly.

Check with:
```bash
sudo apt-get install vainfo
# try the devices you have in /dev/dri/ path
vainfo --display drm --device /dev/dri/renderD128
```

Once you identify your Intel device run the program, e.g.

```bash
./realsense-ir-to-vaapi-h264 640 360 30 5 /dev/dri/renderD128
```

## Testing

Play result raw H.264 file with FFmpeg:

``` bash
# output goes to output.h264 file 
ffplay output.h264
```

## License

realsense-ir-to-vaapi-h264 and HVE are licensed under Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0

This is similiar to LGPL but more permissive:
- you can use it as LGPL in prioprietrary software
- unlike LGPL you may compile it statically with your code
- the license works on file-by-file basis

Like in LGPL, if you modify the code, you have to make your changes available.
Making a github fork with your changes satisfies those requirements perfectly.

Since you are linking to FFmpeg libraries. Consider also avcodec and avutil licensing.

## Additional information

High H.264 profile supports Monochrome Video Format (4:0:0) so there may be room for improvement (I am not sure VAAPI supports it).
